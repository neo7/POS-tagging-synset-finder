Many homes around the world have at least one cat living inside as a pet; in fact many homes have a few cats dwelling in them. People raise these animals for many reasons. Some want them for their companionship. Cats are soft, sweet, and lovable. People like playing with them when they are kittens and once they are older and calm love just snuggling with them. The reason these people keep cats is mainly for enjoyment. However, many other people keep cats to control the mouse or insect population in their house or on their farms. These cats usually do not come into much contact with their owners. Most just stay outside or in the barn where the mice are. But the question is where did cats originally come from, who first domesticated them, and who are their first ancestors? I think that all cats from the giant lions of Africa to the small house cat all came from the same ancestor. I will address and hopefully answer these questions and try to shed some light on the subject.
When I first brought my cat home from the humane society she was a mangy, pitiful animal. It cost a lot to adopt her: forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food, and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal warden. There's a leash law for cats in Fort Collins. If they're not in your yard they have to be on a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me when it's cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and wakes me up, though.
Passages from spoken or written text have a quality of unity that arises in part from the surface properties of the text; syntactic and lexical devices can be used to create a sense of  connectedness between sentences, a phenomenon known as textual cohesion. Of all cohesion devices, lexical cohesion is probably the most amenable to automatic identification. Lexical cohesion arises when words are related semantically, for example in reiteration relations between a term and a synonym or superordinate. Lexical chaining is the process of connecting semantically related words, creating a set of chains that represent different threads of cohesion through the text. This intermediate representation of text has been used in many natural language processing applications, including automatic summarization, infor- mation retrieval, intelligent spell checking, topic segmentation, and hypertext construction
